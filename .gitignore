# NOTE: We instead *check in* Cargo.lock, following advice that:
# "When in doubt, check Cargo.lock into the version control system (e.g. Git). For a better understanding of why and what the alternatives might be, see “Why have Cargo.lock in version control?” in the FAQ. We recommend pairing this with Verifying Latest Dependencies" (<https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/cargo-toml-vs-cargo-lock.html>)
